# Korona
A lightweight program that displays the amount of global Novel Coronavirus cases and deaths. Now with dark mode!

# How it Works
Korona grabs it's data from a .json file from John Hopkins University (thanks so much :D) and then parses out the necessary values using the "org.json" library. It then displays it on a JPanel. Simple.

# Requirements
- Windows/Linux/macOS
- JRE installed
- Internet Connection

# Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Select theme.
3. Get unreasonably sad upon viewing the number of deaths that this virus has caused :(

# Enjoy!
I'm actually begging for feedback, please, test it out and tell me what would be a good addition. 

Thank you, have a nice day.
